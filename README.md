Code for Master Thesis

## Idea
By penalizing splits at the extremes of the feature space, one could avoid end-cut-preference of random forests

## Implementation
The base of the code is taken from https://liorsinai.github.io/coding/2020/12/14/random-forests-jl.html. Adaptions include the switch form a classifier to a regressor and little things here and there to account for my specific setup.
